This repo contains tools related to the distribution and deployment of Seamless (https://github.com/sjdv1982/seamless).

- The seamless-cli commands, written in bash, and using the Docker command line interface.
seamless-cli is distributed as a conda package. 
Building the package requires the *seamless* conda environment to be activated.


- The Seamless scripts and tools, usually accessed via the seamless-cli. Standalone tools are the *FAIR server* and *jobless*

- The Dockerfile to build the rpbs/seamless Docker image.
  This file installs the seamless-framework conda package on top of 
  the rpbs/seamless-deps Docker image, and adds the
  scripts and tools directories from here.
  The Seamless examples and tests are also bundled.
  Command: build-docker.sh

- The Dockerfile for the rpbs/seamless-deps Docker image. 
  This installs the dependencies of Seamless on top of the Jupyter notebook+scipy Docker image.
  Solving the conda environment typically takes 5 minutes.
  Command: build-docker-seamless-deps.sh

- The Dockerfile for the seamless-devel Docker image.
  This is a version of rpbs/seamless without Seamless itself,
  where an external Seamless directory must be provided using SEAMLESS_DIR, mounted into the Docker container at runtime.
  This is used for developing and debugging Seamless.
  Command: build-docker-seamless-devel.sh

# Jobless

Jobless is an experimental workload manager for Seamless.

## Configuring Jobless

Jobless configuration needs to be done in a .yaml file.

There are several documented example configuration files in `jobless/config/*.yaml`. These configure *jobhandlers* for various kinds of transformations.

See `jobless/config/local.yaml` for a minimal example, where bash transformations and bashdocker transformations are run as local jobs.
Other .yaml files in that directory show:
- The use of a Slurm backend.
- The use of Singularity for bashdocker transformations (with Slurm)
- The use of generic transformers. These can run transformations in any language (bash, Python, compiled, ipython-bridged) with any conda environment specified. Transformations are run inside a `rpbs/seamless-minimal` Docker container, and an external location
must be provided where jobless can store Conda environments.
- The use of generic transformers plus Singularity. Instead of in a Docker container, these run inside a Singularity container.
- Generic transformers plus Singularity plus Slurm.


## Setup

***NOTE: Jobless does not run properly under Python3.10. It does run
properly under Python3.8. You are recommended to create a new conda environment for Jobless using `conda create -n jobless 'python=3.8'`***

Jobless runs without containerization. Its dependencies are in `jobless/requirements.txt`, to be installed with `pip -r`. It also requires silk and a few other dependencies, depending on which jobhandlers are being used.
Please read `jobless/requirements.txt` for further instructions.

Launch jobless with `python3 /jobless/jobless.py <config file>.yaml`

## Testing Jobless

First, delete the database and launch jobless. 

### Specific Jobless tests

These are available in `jobless/tests`. They use the Transformer.docker_image values "ubuntu", "rpbs/seamless" and "rpbs/autodock". Make sure that these are available as Docker or Singularity images in the place where the jobs will be run.

If you have run the tests before, you should clean the database first,
see README.txt in the test dir.

Launch a shell in a Seamless container with `seamless-bash`

Run the tests `bash.py`, `docker_.py` and `autodock.py` with python3.
This will connect to a running Jobless instance.
See the .expected-output files in the same folder.
If the output contains instead `Local computation has been disabled for this Seamless instance` or `Environment power cannot be granted: 'docker'`, then the test has failed, because a connection to Jobless
could not be made. `CacheMissError` indicates a failure in connecting
to the Seamless database.

The above tests are for bash/bashdocker transformations and will work for all of the config files in `/jobless/config`. In addition, there are the following tests that require a config file with a generic jobhandler:

- `simple.py`: simple Python transformer.

- `parse-pdb.py`: a Python transformer with a conda environment.

- `compiled.py`: a C++ transformer.

### Testing Jobless in the general case

You can use Seamless's generic `seamless-serve-graph` command together with jobless, for any Seamless graph saved with `ctx.save_graph()` + `ctx.save_zip()` . For example, the "share-pdb" graph in `seamless-tests/highlevel` (bundled with the Seamless Docker image) requires only bash transformers:
```
graph_dir=/home/jovyan/seamless-tests/highlevel
seamless-add-zip $graph_dir/share-pdb.zip
seamless-serve-graph $graph_dir/share-pdb.seamless --database --communion --ncores 0
```
Then, open [http://localhost:5813/ctx/index.html]. 
Use `seamless-serve-graph-interactive` to get an IPython shell instead.
