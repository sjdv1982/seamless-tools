.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Serves a Seamless graph over HTTP inside a seamless-devel Docker
container.
This requires Seamless to be importable on the host system
.PP
The graph is served in an IPython terminal, where the graph can be
modified interactively.
.PP
The current directory is mounted to /cwd, and the serve-graph script is
executed there
.PP
/tmp is mounted as well
.PP
Uses the host network for the Docker container.
Will only work under Linux.
.PP
Seamless has access to the Docker daemon, so it can launch its own
Docker containers via the Docker transformer.
This works only under Linux.
\f[B]NOTE: THIS IS A BIG SECURITY HOLE, IT CAN GIVE ROOT ACCESS TO YOUR
SYSTEM\f[R]
